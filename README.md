# weatherPy
Mapping the weather of various cities across the globe.

In this example, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

The objective was to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
